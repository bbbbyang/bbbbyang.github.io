### My Research
During my graduate study, my main research is about Image Processing along with some Computer Graphics projects. My research of Image Processing mainly focused on De-convolution for Image Local Frequency Analysis which is a novel designed algorithm for de-convolution in frequency domain. I will write a blog about my research in the future.

When I was in my graduate study, research didn't go well at the beginning. I need to fill up with signal background from zero. That two years was not easy, but now I think I still miss my research time.

### My Experience
I learned Android skills during my down time in graduate study. In my github, Giphy and RssReader are the Android projects based on my technique interview for Android developer and I got my first job offer. I was a software developer in SED Systems, Saskatoon. I did C++/Java/Python/JavaScript developement in Server and UI for Sirius XM. I used to keep notes for new skills, in Chinese of course. After half year of working experience, I decide to write blogs. I will convert some useful notes to blogs and keep myself up with new things to me.
